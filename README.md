calendar
========
Problem:
Frost is a very busy person. She has many friends who want to do things with her, but her schedule is usually to busy.
Trying to find the intersection of open timeslots between her and her friend's calendar usually ends in tears and lost friendships.

Solution:
There is only one solution to Frost's scheduling woes: Rose. Rose is a master event scheduler who can easily find time for events where no time exists.
Unfortunately, cloning technology has not yet developed to the point where we can clone Rose, so we have done the next best thing. Create VirtualRose.

VirtualRose is a facebook app that will answer all of lifes problems (around event scheduling)
